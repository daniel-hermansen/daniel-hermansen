### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Daniel! I am a full-stack web developer continously working on improving myself and my abilities as a developer.
<br/>
<br/>
After graduating with a B.S. in Marketing, I decided that I wanted to learn more technical skill and work on building products, which led me to web development. My journey into web development started with Lambda School, now known as Bloom Institute of Technology where I completed their program for Full Stack Development.
Upon graduating from Lambda, I started working as a software tester at iFit Health and Fitness while working to move to full time developer work. 


Apart from web development, I love building things and doing DIY renovation work. I just moved into a new home in northern Utah and I am constantly trying to think of new ways that I can add to it or improve it.
