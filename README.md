### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Daniel! I am a full-stack web developer continously working on improving myself and my abilities as a developer. I am currently seeking a role in full stack or front end development. 
<br/>
<br/>
After graduating with a B.S. in Marketing from Utah State University, I decided that I wanted to learn more technical skill and work on building products, which led me to web development. My journey into web development started with Lambda School, now known as Bloom Institute of Technology where I completed their program for Full Stack Development.
Upon graduating from Lambda, I started working as a software tester at iFit Health and Fitness while working to move to full time developer work. 
I moved on from iFit in February 2022 and began working as a junior applications developer at Smartaira (then called Consolidated Smart Systems), a growing ISP. At Smartaira I helped develop both internal and external applications to assist in reducing operating expenses, execute a successful rebrand, and improve functionality and scalability. With a small development team, I worked on many different tasks and was required to learn new skills like Kotlin, Java, Playwright testing, Prisma, PHP, as well as cloud architecture tools like AWS and Twilio. While my primary tasks focused on building front end products, I did have some experience with the back end and helped with deployment scripts as well.
As the primary development projects were finished and deployed to production there was less immediate development work and executives chose to move forwad with a reduction in force and my position was eliminated

Apart from web development, I love building things and doing DIY renovation work. I just moved into a new home in northern Utah and I am constantly trying to think of new ways that I can add to it or improve it.
