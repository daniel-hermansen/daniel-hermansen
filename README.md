### Hello there! 👋

Hi, I'm Daniel! I am a full-stack web developer continously working on improving myself and my abilities as a developer.

<br/>
After graduating with a B.S. in Marketing, I decided that I wanted to learn more technical skill and work on building products, which led me to web development. Apart from web development, I love building things and doing DIY renovation work. I have been learning different woodworking techniques and just finished building a farmhouse style desk that I currently use.
